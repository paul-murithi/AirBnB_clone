## Description :house:

AirBnB is a complete web application, integrating database storage, 
a back-end API, and front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB.

The project currently only implements the back-end console.

## Console :computer:

The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend 
of HolbertonBnB. It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by 
the application.

### Using the Console

The HolbertonBnB console can be run both interactively and non-interactively. 
To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution 
of the file `console.py` at the command line.

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb) 
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb) 
$
```

Alternatively, to use the HolbertonBnB console in interactive mode, run the 
file `console.py` by itself:

```
$ ./console.py
```

While running in interactive mode, the console displays a prompt for input:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) # our prompt 
```

To quit the console, enter the command `quit`, or input an EOF signal 
(`ctrl-D`).

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) quit
$
```

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) EOF
$
```
